/**
 * UsbMotionSensor.ts
 *
 * WebUSB client for the PS-3219, which the manual calls "a combination wireless
 * and USB sensor". The PASCO packets are identical to the Bluetooth ones — only
 * the envelope differs, and that lives in `PascoMotionProtocol`. See
 * doc/implementation-notes.md for where the framing was recovered from.
 *
 * ── Request/response, not notifications ───────────────────────────────────────
 * USB has no GATT subscribe. Every exchange is one write on the OUT endpoint
 * followed by one read of the IN endpoint, so unlike the Bluetooth client there
 * is no notification handler and no pending-callback bookkeeping; each command
 * awaits its own answer.
 *
 * ── The bridge must be enabled first ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * Claiming the interface is not sufficient. Until the vendor control transfer
 * in `wakeBridge` arrives, both endpoints accept writes and answer nothing at
 * all — which looks exactly like a protocol error and is not one.
